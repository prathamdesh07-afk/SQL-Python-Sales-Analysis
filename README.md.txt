# SQL & Python Sales Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis using **SQL and Python** on a sales dataset.  
The objective is to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends using structured queries and exploratory data analysis.


## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (Data querying and aggregation)
- Python
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains sales-related information including:
- Customer details
- Product details
- Order transactions
- Sales quantity and revenue

Data files are stored in the `data/` folder in CSV format.

## SQL Analysis
The following analyses were performed using SQL:
- Total revenue calculation
- Monthly sales trend analysis
- Revenue by product and category
- Top-performing customers
- Aggregations and joins across multiple tables

SQL queries are available in the `sql/sales_queries.sql` file.

## Python Analysis
Using Python, the following steps were performed:
- Data loading and cleaning using Pandas
- Feature engineering and revenue calculation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization using Matplotlib

Visualizations include:
- Revenue by product
- Monthly sales trend
- Revenue by category
- Top customers by revenue

Python notebook is available in the `python/sales_analysis.ipynb` file.
